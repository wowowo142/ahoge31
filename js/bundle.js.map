// same as /inputSize.xy\n * }\n * ```\n * **resolution**\n *\n * The `resolution` is the ratio of screen (CSS) pixels to real pixels.\n *\n * **inputPixel**\n *\n * `inputPixel.xy` is the size of framebuffer in real pixels, same as `inputSize.xy * resolution`\n * `inputPixel.zw` is inverted `inputPixel.xy`.\n *\n * It's handy for filters that use neighbour pixels, like {@link PIXI.filters.FXAAFilter FXAAFilter}.\n *\n * **inputClamp**\n *\n * If you try to get info from outside of used part of Framebuffer - you'll get undefined behaviour.\n * For displacements, coordinates has to be clamped.\n *\n * The `inputClamp.xy` is left-top pixel center, you may ignore it, because we use left-top part of Framebuffer\n * `inputClamp.zw` is bottom-right pixel center.\n *\n * ```\n * vec4 color = texture2D(uSampler, clamp(modifigedTextureCoord, inputClamp.xy, inputClamp.zw))\n * ```\n * OR\n * ```\n * vec4 color = texture2D(uSampler, min(modifigedTextureCoord, inputClamp.zw))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Additional Information\n *\n * Complete documentation on Filter usage is located in the\n * {@link https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/wiki/v5-Creating-filters Wiki}.\n *\n * Since PixiJS only had a handful of built-in filters, additional filters can be downloaded\n * {@link https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-filters here} from the PixiJS Filters repository.\n *\n * @class\n * @memberof PIXI\n * @extends PIXI.Shader\n */\nexport class Filter extends Shader\n{\n    /**\n     * @param {string} [vertexSrc] - The source of the vertex shader.\n     * @param {string} [fragmentSrc] - The source of the fragment shader.\n     * @param {object} [uniforms] - Custom uniforms to use to augment the built-in ones.\n     */\n    constructor(vertexSrc, fragmentSrc, uniforms)\n    {\n        const program = Program.from(vertexSrc || Filter.defaultVertexSrc,\n            fragmentSrc || Filter.defaultFragmentSrc);\n\n        super(program, uniforms);\n\n        /**\n         * The padding of the filter.
